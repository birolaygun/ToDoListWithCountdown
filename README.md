You can add a mission with date and time. It will show you countdow (day-hour-minute-second)

If you check a mission you added before countdown finish, this mission goes to "done" favicon

If you cancel a mission you added before countdown finish, this mission goes to "canceled" favicon

If you don't check or caancel a mission and countdown finish, this mission goes to "missed" favicon

In this project I use:

- HTML
- CSS
- BootStrap
- JavaScript
- React
- For state managmant I used ContextApi
